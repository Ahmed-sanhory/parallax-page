        <p class="first-par">Computer programming is the process of writing code to facilitate specific actions 
            in a computer, application or software program, and instructs them on how to perform.
            Computer programmers are professionals that create instructions for a computer to execute 
            by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully.</p>

    <h2 class="second-head">Practice</h2>

    
        <p class="second-par">Programming is about being able to solve a programming problem whose solution 
            is a program. In order to do this, you must develop your problem-solving skills by exposing
             yourself to varied kinds of problems and applications. This requires practice.
             It’s much like learning to play piano, or learning to play chess, or even learning to speak 
            a foreign language. It’s all about practice</p>
